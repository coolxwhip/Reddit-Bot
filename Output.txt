He will put fear in the hearts of shoes everywhere
He looks....energetic!

He looks like a Calvin and Hobbes character
He is the exact opposite of a monster.
How is it possible for this gorgeous pupper, to be named monster? He's TOO much cuteness.. look at that amazing smile 😊🤗❤
What breed?
Who would name something so cute “Monster”?
Puppy! And he has a HAPPY FACE!
Hi Happy monster😊

Now you just need a hill for him to approach over.
But did they do the monster mash
My(Your) Pet Monster!

Feels like that name could be a foreshadowing of his brutish adult form, good luck inlaws! 🤞
This Monster stole my heart with his cuteness <3
OMG!!! Monster you are an absolutely beautiful Doggo 😊. Hello and many smoochies. ❤️
Wow! He looks very fierce!
/r/DisneyEyes /u/mmmmmmmmichaelscott
"Hello Monster, he-... Hello monstuh."
Why did they name him after a energy drink
Such an interesting Monster too! My stars... if such an interesting Monster can't have an interesting hairdo, I don't know what things are coming to...
could he be any happier !!!
he looks like the happiest little pup ever
not to be dramatic but i would die for monster
Seems appropriate for a hideous creature such as that.
I want a monster! What kind of dog is he?
Happy boooooi!!
Thank you for T h e happy hormones.
Adorably monstrous!
the name fits so well... i love them
I love how owners give their dogs prophetic names lol
I'M TERRIFIED OF THAT MONSTER
Make a new meme crypto, Monstercoin!
Like zoinks scoob!
I am in love with Monster
Is his name Launchpad?
Can I use this as a wholesome meme template?
Monster for love and snacks?
Blorp
Does that make him your Monster-in-law?? ;)
Him looks like him gonna EATCHUU UP
I have never seen a brighter smile in my life
Cute as can be, but tell him to cheer down.
If I had that pup, he'd lose his nose from too much kissing.

Very cute little pup.
this is the purest puppy i've ever seen
So Monstrous! Hi Monster!! (You are so cute you changed the whole adjective).
What breed is that?
Mr. Smiley

Face-lick attack. Engaged.
Monster looks like he has a lot of energy.
::::adorableness overload::::
Hes very scary
very Happy furry Friend...welcome Monster
Perfect name for a perfect pup❤️
I already love you Monster! Beware, I named one of my Dogs Chaos & he lived up to the name
Looks like our chu-weeny did when he was younger. I wonder it he will have opposable front paws like ours does: he holds his toys in his paws.
Monster is your new in-paw
Am I allowed to call that cute boy Pluto?
Ferocious.
His name reminds me of the Chihuahua that my mother-in-law adopted. The shelter workers had named him Killer. He was anything but, so she renamed him Angelo. 

Angelo turned out to be a little ball of neuroses, but aggression wasn't one of them. He was a sweetheart.
Hi monster!!
A very heavy name for a puppy with such a happy face ... Hello Monster
I think you mean.... MONSTAAAHHH!
Look at that monster between your legs!
Holy god, that's a cute dog.
Ferocious.
looks like a ferret
So when he is hiding under your bed and he scared you, do you say 


##IM FRIENDS WITH THE MONSTER THATS UNDER MY BED##
This pup is gonna be equal parts headaches and happiness.
Ok so I read the title as “my monster-in-laws” but I’m guessing you have a slightly better relationship than that lol
Finner
...Anything but!!
Lawsy, that's a hideous Monster!
I want him
he looks so excited and ready to grow into that name
My boy looked exactly the same when he was little :D
Cartoon levels of happy cuteness omg
Hello Monster
That pup in that picture is happier than I’ll ever be
This reminded me of one of my son's favorite songs years ago when he was a toddler about a dog named Monster! https://youtu.be/m1rGXK_Z6co
“Hey guy! What we doin’ today?”
Hairy dinosaur!
Cute dog, but I think you'll regret the name.
r/puppysmiles
Some family friends just got a bear dog or something along those lines, and his name is Kimi, but they call him monster sometimes. I have never before seen a puppy so intent on fighting everything it sees.
Absolutely adorable
Doesn’t look like Monster. More like Wiseguy.
Monster looks like a Disney character and I’m here for it 🥰😍
Probably the cutest thing i’ve ever seen
He may look cute, but in reality he's a monster
That is no monster.
I want him!!
that face.. priceless. every doggo deserves to have that feeling
What a horrible name. I’m sorry but sheesh. Better than spike or Fido i suppose
Might wanna pick a new name, the one you came up with is incredibly deceiving
great pic!
I love a sweet lil boo monster😘
Hello Monster!
Monster is the best.  I love Monster.
Aww sweet baby! He’s so happy I love it! The name made me chuckle.
What a cute boi!
That's the cutest monster ever!
Is the name inspired from Monster in law?
A truer name has never been given. Lol
A beautiful dog!💋
Looking at that face would surely make anyone feel better.  The face of happy to be alive!
What a name for beauty!
He's thrilled to have found a great family.
That is one cute little pup!!
"Who's that jumping up in my lap? Is it a Monster? Is it a Monsterrrrr?"
so cute
Reminds me of that toothless kid on stranger things.
Oooooooh! I see so much future troubles in those eyes!
That’s my poodles nickname
Unreal
Cool
He's so cute, he looks like a bowling pin.
Who's my little Monstaaaa " It's me Grog! I'm the little Monstaaaa!"
His name is very ironic.
Hello

W-wow what a n-nice tounge.

Give the poor thing a proper name!
